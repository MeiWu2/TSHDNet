# TSHDNet: Spatio-Temporal Heterogeneous Decoupling Network

This repository contains the official implementation of the TSHDNet framework, a novel solution for predicting spatio-temporal traffic flow data in complex urban multi-modal transportation systems. TSHDNet adeptly captures intricate spatial dependencies and dynamic trends among diverse road segments, addressing the challenge of accurate traffic flow prediction.

## Overview

The TSHDNet framework comprises a combination of temporal and spatial modules to capture both temporal and spatial characteristics of traffic flow. The architecture is designed to reveal the underlying relationship between traffic patterns and spatio-temporal heterogeneity, enhancing our understanding of traffic dynamics and improving the accuracy of traffic flow prediction.
